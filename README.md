# Genetic biomarkers and clinical efficacy in non-small lung cancer patients undergoing immune therapy
**Masters thesis D.Lord** 

This project aims to identify key genetic biomarkers that correlate to clinical efficacy (partial or complete response, progression free survival, or overall survival) in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing immune therapy treatment. This is done through genetic profiling of tumor DNA deriving from blood samples. NGS data will be processed and DNA variants will be evaluated using various bioinformatic tools. The identification of these key genetic biomarkers will hopefully pave the way for the generation of a predictive model in regards to immune therapy outcome and thus a more personalized treatment of non-small lung cancer.
