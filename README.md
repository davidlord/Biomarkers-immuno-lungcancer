# Project description

**Master's thesis, David Lord 2021 - 2022**

This project aims to identify key genetic biomarkers that correlate to clinical efficacy (partial or complete response, progression free survival or overall survival) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment. NGS data - derived from patient tumor samples - is processed and analyzed through various bioinformatic tools. Extra emphasis is here put on setting up a pipeline to evaluate patient microsatellite instability (MSI) status. 

The long term aim of this project is to create a predictive model of patient treatment outcome (regarding NSCLS patients undergoing immunotherapy) based on various metrics deduced from patient DNA-data.
